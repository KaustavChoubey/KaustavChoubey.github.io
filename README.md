# MASGroupProject1

This is a group project that we (Kaustav Choubey, Barbara Taraska, James) did in BSc Mathematics Year 1. Here, we created a programme to calculate the rook polynomial for any chessboard (with blocked squares as well) and create a mini mini version of the chess engine which performs one single task.
